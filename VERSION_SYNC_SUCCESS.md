# Version Sync Resolution - SUCCESS ✅

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the Tauri plugin version mismatch error:

```
Error `package > version` must be a semver string
```

## Root Cause

The `tauri-plugin-dialog` had mismatched versions:

- **Rust crate (Cargo.toml)**: `2.4.0`
- **NPM package (package.json)**: `2.3.0` ❌

## Solution Applied

Updated `package.json` to align with the Rust crate version:

```json
"@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog": "2.4.0"
```

## Final Version Alignment

All Tauri plugins now have matching versions:

| Plugin | Rust Crate | NPM Package | Status |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| dialog | 2.4.0      | 2.4.0       | ✅     |
| fs     | 2.4.2      | 2.4.2       | ✅     |
| opener | 2.5.0      | 2.5.0       | ✅     |

## Verification

- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully with `bun install`
- ✅ Full production build completed without errors
- ✅ All Tauri plugins now have matching major/minor versions

## Key Learnings

1. **Tauri requires precise version alignment** between Rust crates and NPM packages
2. **NPM package versions can lag behind** Rust crate releases
3. **Check npmjs.com** to verify latest available NPM package versions
4. **The sync script works correctly** - this was a manual update needed for a newer plugin version

## Next Steps

- Monitor future plugin updates for version mismatches
- Consider automated checks in CI/CD for version alignment
- Document this process for future reference
