# Android APK Naming Simplification

## Summary

We've successfully simplified the Android APK naming approach by removing all the complex Gradle modifications and replacing them with a simple file renaming strategy in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## What Was Removed

1. **Complex Gradle customization script** (`scripts/customize-android-naming.sh`)

   - Removed 80+ lines of Kotlin DSL injection code
   - Eliminated build.gradle.kts modifications
   - No more type safety concerns with generated files

2. **Android-specific version handling** in `sync-versions.js`

   - Removed `calculateVersionCode()` function
   - Removed `handleAndroidVersioning()` function
   - Removed tauri.properties file management
   - Simplified from 144 lines to 36 lines

3. **Complex documentation files**
   - Removed `COMPLETE_GRADLE_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Removed `GRADLE_TYPE_SAFETY_FIX.md`

## What Was Simplified

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

- **Before**: Complex Gradle injection before build
- **After**: Simple file renaming after build, before upload

```yaml
# NEW: Simple renaming step
- name: Rename Android files for release
  shell: bash
  run: |
    # Get app version from package.json
    APP_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
    APP_NAME="VaultNote"

    # Rename APK files
    APK_DIR="src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release"
    if [ -d "$APK_DIR" ]; then
      cd "$APK_DIR"
      for apk in app-*.apk; do
        if [ -f "$apk" ]; then
          new_name="${APP_NAME}_${APP_VERSION}_${apk#app-}"
          echo "Renaming $apk to $new_name"
          mv "$apk" "$new_name"
        fi
      done
    fi

    # Rename AAB files
    AAB_DIR="src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease"
    if [ -d "$AAB_DIR" ]; then
      cd "$AAB_DIR"
      for aab in app-*.aab; do
        if [ -f "$aab" ]; then
          new_name="${APP_NAME}_${APP_VERSION}_${aab#app-}"
          echo "Renaming $aab to $new_name"
          mv "$aab" "$new_name"
        fi
      done
    fi
```

### 2. Version Synchronization Script

- **Before**: 144 lines with Android version code calculation, tauri.properties management
- **After**: 36 lines that simply sync package.json version to Cargo.toml

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Much easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reliability**: No more Gradle type safety issues or generated file persistence problems
3. **Flexibility**: Works regardless of Tauri's Android build system changes
4. **Speed**: No complex build modifications, just simple file operations

## Result

- APK files: `app-universal-release.apk` → `VaultNote_0.21.2_universal-release.apk`
- AAB files: `app-universal-release.aab` → `VaultNote_0.21.2_universal-release.aab`

This achieves the exact same naming goal with ~90% less complexity and zero risk of build system compatibility issues.
