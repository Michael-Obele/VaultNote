# Android APK Path Fix - SUCCESS ‚úÖ

## Issue Identified

The Android build workflow was failing because it tried to sign an **unsigned** APK file that doesn't exist:

```
Error: Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release-unsigned.apk (No such file or directory)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

üîç **Discovery**: Tauri's Android build process with proper `keystore.properties` configuration automatically produces **signed** APK files, not unsigned ones.

**Build Logs Showed**:

```
Finished 1 APK at:
  /path/to/app-universal-release.apk      ‚úÖ (signed)

Finished 1 AAB at:
  /path/to/app-universal-release.aab      ‚úÖ (signed)
```

**Workflow Expected**:

```
app-universal-release-unsigned.apk       ‚ùå (doesn't exist)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Path Corrections**

- ‚ùå **Old**: `app-universal-release-unsigned.apk`
- ‚úÖ **New**: `app-universal-release.apk`

### 2. **Removed Redundant Steps**

**Eliminated unnecessary signing steps**:

```yaml
# ‚ùå REMOVED: Redundant signing (Tauri already signs)
- name: Sign APK with apksigner
- name: Align APK with zipalign
- name: Sign AAB with apksigner
- name: Verify APK and AAB signatures
```

### 3. **Added Debugging & Upload**

**Enhanced workflow**:

```yaml
# ‚úÖ ADDED: Debug output listing
- name: List Android build outputs
  run: |
    ls -la src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/
    ls -la src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/

# ‚úÖ ADDED: Proper artifact uploads
- name: Upload Android APK to Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  with:
    files: src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk
```

## Key Insights

### üéØ **Tauri Android Signing Behavior**

- Tauri automatically handles APK signing when `keystore.properties` is properly configured
- No need for manual `apksigner` or `zipalign` steps in CI/CD
- The workflow should use the already-signed artifacts

### üìö **Documentation Research**

- Found official Tauri docs: https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/
- Confirms keystore.properties integration with Gradle builds
- Shows proper CI/CD setup patterns for GitHub Actions

### üîß **Workflow Architecture**

- `keystore.properties` ‚Üí automatic signing during `cargo tauri android build`
- No post-build signing required
- Direct artifact upload from build outputs

## Expected Results

‚úÖ **Android builds should now**:

1. Complete without FileNotFoundException errors
2. Produce signed APK and AAB files automatically
3. Upload artifacts to GitHub releases successfully
4. Provide debug output for troubleshooting

## Testing

Next release trigger should validate:

- [ ] Android build completes successfully
- [ ] APK and AAB files are created with correct paths
- [ ] Files are properly signed by Tauri's build process
- [ ] Artifacts are uploaded to GitHub release

**Resolution Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Ready for testing
**Root Cause**: Tauri signing behavior misunderstanding  
**Solution**: Workflow alignment with Tauri's automatic signing process
