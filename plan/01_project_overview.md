# Project Overview: VaultNote

## 1. Project Name
VaultNote

## 2. Description
VaultNote is a desktop application built with Tauri (Rust) and SvelteKit (Frontend). It integrates three core features into a single productivity hub:
- A markdown editor with an autosave feature.
- A multi-item clipboard manager.
- A secure password generator and storage vault.

The primary goal of VaultNote is to streamline common developer and user workflows like note-taking, managing clipboard history, and handling credentials securely. It is also designed as a learning project to gain hands-on experience with Rust and Tauri.

## 3. Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a practical and secure tool that addresses real-world productivity challenges.
- To provide a structured learning path for mastering Rust and the Tauri framework for desktop application development.
- To build a high-quality application that is both functional and user-friendly.

## 4. Core Technologies
- **Backend & Core Logic**: Rust
  - Chosen for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
  - Rust will handle all file system operations, clipboard interactions, and cryptographic functions for password management.
- **Desktop App Framework**: Tauri
  - A lightweight framework for building secure and fast desktop applications using web technologies for the frontend.
  - It allows for a secure bridge between the Rust backend and the web-based UI.
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
  - A modern web framework for building reactive and performant user interfaces.
  - SvelteKit's component-based architecture is ideal for creating a modular and maintainable frontend for VaultNote.
